# ethernautCTF
Recently, I have been playing the openzeppelin ethernaut ctf and using it to fill in any gaps in my knowledge.

Although there are so many great solutions, I still think I should create a new repo and write some notes to record my own thought process.

And in order to practice my English writing skills, I will write all the solutions in English.
