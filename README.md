最近在玩openzeppelin ethernaut ctf，顺便查漏补缺知识点

虽然网上已经有很多写的很好的题解，但是还是想开个repo做个简单的学习记录

为了练习我的英文写作，所有题解都用英语写

Recently, I have been playing the openzeppelin ethernaut ctf and using it to fill in any gaps in my knowledge.

Although there are so many great solutions, I still think I should create a new repo and write some notes to record my own thought process.

And in order to practice my English writing skills, I will write all the solutions in English.
