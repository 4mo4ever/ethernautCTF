# **Level 6 -- Delegation**

## ***Objectives***
* Claim ownership of the contract
---
## ***Thought Process***
In the `Delegation` contractâ€˜s `fallback()` function, we can see that it uses low-level function `delegatecall()` to call the functions in the contract `Delegate` .

When contract A performs a delegatecall to contract B, A will use B's execution logic, but the storage slot in B will not be modified. Instead, the corresponding storage slot value in A will be modified.
For example, in both the `Delegation()` and `Delegate()` contracts, there are two `address` parameter named `owner` and both of them are the `slot0` in their respective contract. 

If we use the `Delegation` contract to delegatecall the `pwn()` function in the `Delagate` contract, the owner of the `Delagate` contract will not be changed. However, the value at the same slot position in the `Delegation` will be replaced by the value of the `msg.sender`.

## ***Solution***
``` ts
> await contract.sendTransaction({data: web3.utils.keccak256("pwn()")})
```
